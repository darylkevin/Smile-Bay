Hi! We are Dr. Richelle and Dr. Rizael! We are schoolmates and friends turned professional partners. We opened Smile Bay Dental Clinic to provide affordable and high quality dentistry for residents of San Pedro, Laguna and nearby communities.

We both graduated from the University of the Philippines College of Dentistry and then ventured out into post-graduate training for Orthodontics, Endodontics, Restorative, and Esthetic Dentistry. 

Our practice revolves around General Dentistry with a network of on-call specialists for Pediatric Dentistry, Oral Surgery, Implants, and Temporomandibular Joint Disorder Management.
